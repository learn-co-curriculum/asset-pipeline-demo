# Asset Pipeline Demo

## Resources

* [Layouts and Rendering in Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)

Rails includes the "Asset Pipeline" to help manage dependencies for JavaScript
and CSS.

Rails has a special place it looks for CSS and JavaScript files. It
expects them to be in `app/assets/javascripts` and `app/assets/stylesheets`.
You'll see two files `application.js` and `application.css` already in these
asset directories. These files define dependences on other `.js` and `.css`
files. They each include a line `*= require_tree .` which will automatially
include all the `.js` and `.css` files in that directory.

Rails makes these methods (`stylesheet_link_tag` and `javascript_include_tag`)
available so you can render references to JavaScript and CSS in your views.
These lines are included inside the main app template
`app/views/layout/application.html.erb`.

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all" %>
<%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
```

## How to Get It Working
Refer to [this commit diff](https://github.com/moondump/asset-pipeline-demo/commit/0087cb686bdead899d7263988c6410d7d7f25ec2)
to see what changes it takes to get your own JavaScript attached to your web
pages using Rails Asset Pipeline.

* Create a file `app/assets/javascripts/my_javascript.js`
* Create a file `app/views/application/index.html.erb`
* Add the following contents to each file


**app/assets/javascripts/my_javascript.js**
```js
document.write('hello from my custom tiny JS file') 
```

**app/views/application/index.html.erb**
```html
<h1>Just Some Tiny Custom HTML</h1>
```

Modify the `ApplicationController` to have a method that renders the
Application index view. This refers to the tiny HTML file above which
lives at `app/views/application/index.html.erb`.

**app/controllers/application_controller.rb**
```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  def index
    render "index"
  end
end
```

Include a route that renders the view. Views are rendered within the overall
application layout defined in `app/views/layout/application.html.erb`. Since
the overall layout includes the call to `javascript_include_tag` and
`stylesheet_link_tag` the view will include proper references to all the CSS
and JavaScript files placed in your `app/assets/javascripts` folder.

**config/routes.rb**
```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/', to: 'application#index'
end
```

## Cache Busting
Have you ever edited a JavaScript or CSS file, saved it, refreshed your browser
and not seen changes come through? Sometimes this happens when your browser
caches the file you've changed. The browser notices you've retrieved
`/src/my_javascript.js` before and it skips downloading it again because it
thinks it hasn't changed. 
 
Rails helps prevent this by appending a specific hash at the end of a link to
any CSS or JavaScript file. The hash makes the file look like
`/src/my_javascript.self-af89d234c3e28js`. The hash is generated based on the
contents of the file. If you edit the file the file contents change and the
hash will change. The new hash in the filename will force the browser "bust
it's cache" and download the file again because it thinks it's never seen this
file before.

So, instead of your files always having the same name (like below) the Rails
Asset Pipeline adds a hash to each filename (seen further below). This helps
prevent browsers from using stale resource. Viola.
